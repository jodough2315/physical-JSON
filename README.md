# physical-JSON

So, I am pretty new to programming, and I haven't contributed to, or created any github projects before. This is one I thought of when learning about JSON. I have no idea whether it will end up being useful to anyone but the basic goal is to convert physical and chemical properties of real world materials into JSON. Maybe it can be used in some future physics engine or computer modeling or something. I'll be adding to this semi-regularly, as I already know it's going to take some time. 

If you want to contribute, I have included a sample below.

*********NOTE: All temperatures are in Kelvin (K), and only numeric values are given. 
Atomic weights are averaged.
Wikipedia page for each element is sufficient information until further notice******

{"Atomic Elements": [
{"elementName":"Hydrogen", "Symbol":"H", "atomicNumber":1, "atomicWeight":1.008, "meltingPoint":13.99, "boilingPoint":20.271}
etc...

***NOTE: I have suddenly realized this might be more complicated data than I originally thought. Open to suggestions.***
